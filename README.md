# **Terraform-StorageAccount**

I have configured the azurerm provider to interact with Azure and create resources in it. Then, I have created a resource group in Azure. Lastly, I have created a storage account in Azure within my resource group.

### **Next steps:**
- add yaml
- read/modify terraform states from a storage account so we mantein the .tfstates in a common site
- take ids and secrets needed from an azure keavault or from environment variables (as variable groups in the library of Azure DevOps)
